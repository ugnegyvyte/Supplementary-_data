Supplementary Figure 1: Differential expression of validated miRNAs in GIST detected by TLDA. The red color represents significantly (Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.01) differentially expressed miRNAs with fold change > 2, while blue color represents non-differentially expressed miRNAs. 

Supplementary Figure 2: Differential expression of KIT and PDGFRA in GIST and adjacent tissues. Expression levels of KIT and PDGFRA genes were analyzed using qRT-PCR. The data is represented as log22(-∆Ct).

Supplementary Figure 3: Correlation analysis of miRNAs and their potential target genes KIT and PDGFRA. Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated using normalized microRNA and mRNA expression data. P-value below 0.05 was considered significant. 

Supplementary Figure 4: Statistical power of the study. The colored lines show statistical powers for different effect size (fold change). The intersection of vertical and horizontal lines show the significantly (p < 0.01) detectable effect size with 80 % statistical power in this study.

Supplementary Figure 5: TLDA data correction for batch effects using combat. Plots on the left side show ∆CT values before the correction, while plots on the right side show ∆CT values after the correction.
